Nowadays and next years I'm an Android developer, also like to play with microcontrollers and bring their benefits to business. Writes lots of useful Android stuff on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/12544067/mxkmn?tab=answers).

Just the best university timetable app in the world. It automatically adds schedule to the Android pre-installed calendar, allowing it to be displayed in any widget or on a smartwatches. Works by parsing web pages and automatically synronises data several times a day.

|<img src="photos/projects/tracker_icon.webp" alt="icon" width="48px">|Offline tracker|
|:-:|:-:|

<img src="photos/projects/tracker.jpg" alt="Screenshots" width="70%" />

An application to track people in an area without internet coverage. Receives data from trackers via BLE (they locate with GPS and communicate via LoRa in a mesh network), which were developed with me. Offline-first approach. Application developed entirely by me on behalf of the Irkutsk Oil Company.

* Architecture: Multimodule approach in monorepository for all Irkutsk Oil projects; Single Activity; MVI/UDF/Clean Architecture with Jetpack ViewModel and Kotlin Flows; Coroutines; Dagger Hilt.

* Local memory: Room.
* Tools and testing: Tracer by OK.Tech; Detekt; KtLint; Gradle convention plugins; MockK; Compose Tests.

|Migrations since project start|
|:-:|

* Singlemodule -> Multimodule;
* Default repository -> Monorepo for Irkutsk Oil;
* Google Maps (Maps Compose library) -> Google Maps (Views) -> OpenStreetMap via Osmdroid library (Views);
* BLE via pure Android SDK -> Kable lib;
* Self-made firmware for microcontroller -> [Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org/) based modified firmware (so I had to understand the workings of Meshtastic's Protobuf-based communication protocol without documentation);
* Network connections via pure OkHttp -> Ktor Client;
* Accompanist permissions handling -> Self-written permissions handling for Compose;
* Gradle with Groovy -> Gradle with Kotlin and Gradle convention plugins;
* Firebase Crashlytics/Analytics -> Tracer ([adv](https://apptracer.ru/doc/about)an[ced](https://habr.com/ru/companies/vk/articles/757416/) crashlytic and monitoring service).

|Additional info|
|:-:|

Thanks to experience, I now know that GMaps for Compose is very unstable and it makes sense to use an implementation of all actions via View and an additional class to abstract the map capabilities. Migrated to OSM at the request of the customer.

Also it's my graduation work:

An application for linen accounting in laundries. Receives employee data from an RFID scanner via BLE, which was developed in team with me. Offline-first approach. Developed completely by me by order of Irkutsk Oil Company.

|Additional info|
|:-:|

As this was the second project for Irkutsk Oil Company, a monorepository was established for all current and future projects, which increased development speed by times and greatly improved code quality and component reusability.

### At Summer Schools 2022 by Yandex Academy

We've got [max rating](https://github.com/mxkmn/HackathonAndroidBlindy?tab=readme-ov-file#result), but 2nd place :/

### My [weather station](https://github.com/mxkmn/Esp8266WeatherStation/blob/main/README_ru.md)

Built almost from scratch in 2021. It's cool, but I want to rebuild it again (to use new MCU and support RTOS features, make it smaller and also rewrite some crappy code).

<details><summary><b>My experience and statistics</b></summary>

I've worked as an individual and as a team developer in a startup and small outstaff studio.

As a student participated in 9 hackathons, taking 2nd place twice and 3rd place four times. One day I'll get the first, hopefully.

Loving coding since 2015, professionally since 2021. [My CV (RU)](pdfs/cv.pdf)

## Some interests beyond development

<details><summary><b>Music&sound</b></summary>

Because everyone likes it and writes about on personal pages ü•±.

So, if you want to know about my taste in melodic screamo kircore rap: [Deezer profile](http://deezer.com/en/profile/4884764102).

It also requires quality audio equipment, figuring it out was fun and it led to a [set of posts with my conclusions](https://4pda.to/forum/index.php?showtopic=975324) (RU). Comparison of 25+ pairs of TWS included. Right now, my choice is the magnificent Noble FoKus Pro.
